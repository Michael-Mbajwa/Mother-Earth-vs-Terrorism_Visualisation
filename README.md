TITLE: Mother Nature vs Terrorism : Which should scare us more?

Objective of my visualization is to compare the deaths caused by mother nature against that caused by Terrorism across the globe.

More background would be provided. But for now the rough idea is basically me showing reasons why much care should be given to mitigate natural disasters 
as has been given to the much more violent terrorism.
