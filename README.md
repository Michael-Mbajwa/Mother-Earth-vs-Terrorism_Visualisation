# R_Visualisation_project

TITLE: Mother Nature vs Terrorism 

INTRODUCTION
High impact deaths caused by an event such as terrorism usually makes headlines, heightens tension among the population and leads to more precautionary measures which in turn reduce the likelihood of such events occurring. While this is very commendable, there are other causes of death (in this context, natural disasters) which may not make as much headlines as a high impact one like terrorism. The objective of my visualization is to compare the deaths caused by natural disasters against that caused by Terrorism across the globe. While I am in full support of the media coverage terrorism attracts, the aim of my visualization is to show reasons why deaths caused by natural disasters should also receive alot of prolonged media attention. Not for the sake of scaring people, but for the sake of ensuring leaders, stakeholders and key decision makers are pressured into taking proactive steps to mitigate the future risks of natural disasters.

ABOUT MY DATA
For this project, I use two data sets both gotten from https://ourworldindata.org. 

APPROACH
I approached this project the following way. 
Step 1: I first created a visualization for the deaths in terrorism. I used a circular bar plot for this visualization. I was inspired by these visualization https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/circular-barplot.html.

Step 2: I create a scatter plot to show the deaths caused by natural disasters. Because there are different segments of natural disasters, my chart shows deaths broken down into each segment. I got inspiration for this plot from https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters?country=. All codes were written by me and not copied from anywhere.

Step 3: I created a table summarizing the total decadal deaths due to natural disasters and terrorism.

Step 4: For this final plot, I combined three separate plots into one. My inspiration was from a plot by https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/osmguy/viz/50YearsofAFCvsNFCMatchups/50YearsofAFCvs_NFCMatchups. I simply recreated this plot on R using several tricks.
